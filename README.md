Cuckoo Cycle is the first graph-theoretic proof-of-work,
and the most memory bound, yet with instant verification.

Proofs take the form of a length 42 cycle in a bipartite graph with N nodes and
N/2 edges, with N scalable from millions to billions and beyond.

This makes verification trivial: compute the 42x2 edge endpoints with one
initialising blake2b and 84 very cheap siphash-2-4 hashes, check that each
endpoint occurs twice, and that you come back to the starting point only after
traversing 42 edges (this also makes Cuckoo Cycle, unlike Hashcash, relatively
immune from Grover's quantum search algorithm).

A final blake2b hash on the sorted 42 nonces can check whether the 42-cycle
meets a difficulty target.

This is implemented in under 220 lines of C code (files src/{siphash.h,cuckoo.h,cuckoo.c}).

From this point of view, Cuckoo Cycle is a very simple PoW,
requiring hardly any code, time, or memory to verify.

Finding a 42-cycle, on the other hand, is far from trivial,
requiring considerable resources, and some luck
(for a given header, the odds of its graph having a L-cycle are about 1 in L).

The memory efficient miner uses 3 bits per edge and is bottlenecked by
accessing random 2-bit counters, making it memory latency bound.  The roughly
4x faster latency avoiding miner, a rewrite from xenoncat's bounty winning solver,
uses 33 bits per edge and is bottlenecked by bucket sorting. making it memory bandwidth bound.

ASICs
--------------
The most cost effective Cuckoo Cycle mining hardware could consist of a relatively cheap and tiny ASIC
containing a few dozen simple cores and memory controllers, coupled with 3D-stacked DRAM using
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory">High Bandwidth Memory</a> interface.
The ASIC, running the faster bandwidth bound solver, wouldn't be very compute intensive.
Since it only needs to keep the memory bandwidth saturated, its optimization would soon reach a point of
diminishing returns. The hardware and energy costs will be dominated by the memory chips,
which the commodity DRAM market is already constantly optimizing.
Although running the memory efficient latency bound solver would allow for processing many graph
instances simultaneously, the induced latencies would multiply and overall throughput remain lower.
Unless, that is, a new kind of RAM were developed that is much more cost efficient for random accesses.

An indirectly useful Proof of Work
--------------
Traditional DRAM architectures are ill-suited for energy-efficient operation because
they are designed to fetch much more data than required, having long been optimized for cost-per-bit
rather than energy efficiency.
Thus there is enormous energy savings potential in the development of more efficient DRAM designs.
Papers like
<a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/pubs/isca10.pdf">Rethinking DRAM design and organization for energy-constrained multi-cores</a> and
<a href="http://mbsullivan.info/attachments/papers/yoon2012dgms.pdf">The Dynamic Granularity Memory System</a>
have proposed several sensible and promising designs with large energy efficiency improvements.
If any such designs could demonstrate a throughput/Watt benefit for latency bound solving,
then Cuckoo Cycle could strongly incentivize their development.

Cycle finding
--------------
The algorithm implemented in lean_miner.h runs in time linear in N.
(Note that running in sub-linear time is out of the question, as you could
only compute a fraction of all edges, and the odds of all 42 edges of a cycle
occurring in this fraction are astronomically small).

Memory-wise, it uses N/2 bits to maintain a subset of all edges (potential
cycle edges) and N additional bits (or 40N bits in the latency avoiding algorithm)
to trim the subset in a series of edge trimming rounds.
This is the phase that takes the vast majority of runtime.

Once the subset is small enough, an algorithm inspired by Cuckoo Hashing
is used to recognise all cycles, and recover those of the right length.

Performance
--------------

The runtime of a single proof attempt for a 2^30 node graph on a 4GHz i7-4790K is 10.5 seconds
with the single-threaded mean solver, using 3200MB (or 2200MB with slower cycle recovery).
This reduces to 3.5 seconds with 4 threads (3x speedup).

Using an order of magnitude less memory (just under 200MB),
the lean solver takes 32.8 seconds per proof attempt.
Its multi-threading performance is less impressive though,
with 2 threads still taking 25.6 seconds and 4 taking 20.5 seconds.

I claim that these implementations are reasonably optimal,
secondly, that trading off (less) memory for (more) running time,
incurs at least one order of magnitude extra slowdown,
and finally, that mean_miner.cu is a reasonably optimal GPU miner.
The latter runs about 2.4x faster on an NVIDA 1080Ti than mean_miner on an Intel Core-i7 CPU.
To that end, I offer the following bounties:

CPU Speedup Bounties
--------------
$10000 for an open source implementation that finds 42-cycles twice as fast
as lean_miner, using no more than 1 byte per edge.

$10000 for an open source implementation that finds 42-cycles twice as fast
as mean_miner, regardless of memory use.

Linear Time-Memory Trade-Off Bounty
--------------
$10000 for an open source implementation that uses at most N/k bits while finding 42-cycles up to 10 k times slower, for any k>=2.

All of these bounties require N ranging over {2^28,2^30,2^32} and #threads
ranging over {1,2,4,8}, and further assume a high-end Intel Core i7 or Xeon and
recent gcc compiler with regular flags as in my Makefile.

GPU Speedup Bounty
--------------
$5000 for an open source implementation for a consumer GPU
that finds 42-cycles twice as fast as mean_miner.cu on 2^30 node graphs on comparable hardware.

The Makefile defines corresponding targets leancpubounty, meancpubounty, tmtobounty, and gpubounty.

Double and fractional bounties
------------------------
Improvements by a factor of 4 will be rewarded with double the regular bounty.

In order to minimize the risk of missing out on less drastic improvements,
I further offer a fraction FRAC of the regular CPU/GPU-speedup bounty, payable in bitcoin cash,
for improvements by a factor of 2^FRAC, where FRAC is at least one-tenth.
Note that 2^0.1 is about a 7% improvement.

Happy bounty hunting!
